ACADEMIC PROJECT SYNOPSIS

Title: Implementation of Algorithms using CUDA and their performance comparison in
CPU vs. GPU modes.

Organization: Aeronautical Development Establishment (ADE), DRDO Ministry of Defense.

Description: The objective of the project is to implement and study the performance of the
algorithms in CUDA (GPU) and non-CUDA (CPU) mode. The three algorithms implemented
were: Quick Hull, Diamond-square and Smithâ€“Waterman algorithms. The performance of each
of these algorithms were compared (CUDA and non-CUDA) in terms of execution time and
report was created.

Technology: C and CUDA C
